# Product Mission

## Pitch

Follow the Money is a nonpartisan civic transparency platform that helps politically engaged citizens and investigative researchers understand the funding patterns behind candidates, PACs, employers, and industries by providing explainable dashboards, graph visualizations, and NLP-powered alignment signals that scrutinize every party equally.

## Users

### Primary Users

- Investigative journalists: Need fast answers about who funds candidates and why, regardless of party affiliation.
- Civic researchers & watchdog groups: Track macro trends across industries, employers, and committees to inform reports or policy debates without partisan framing.
- Engaged citizens & voters (across the political spectrum): Independently study candidates, follow donation trails, and compare public messaging with funding sources before elections.

### User Personas

**Investigative Journalist** (30-55)

- **Role:** Reporter on politics, corruption, or civic accountability beats
- **Context:** Works under tight deadlines, juggling spreadsheets of FEC filings and press releases
- **Pain Points:** Slow manual reconciliation of donations; hard to show narratives visually; limited technical tooling
- **Goals:** Publish data-backed stories, surface conflicts of interest, stay ahead of Election Day coverage

**Civic Tech Analyst** (25-45)

- **Role:** Researcher or analyst for non-profits, think tanks, or watchdog organizations
- **Context:** Builds reports and dashboards for stakeholders, needs repeatable methodology
- **Pain Points:** Fragmented data sources, opaque PAC relationships, hard to track changes over time
- **Goals:** Produce credible analysis, build interactive tools for the public, influence policy discussions

**Engaged Citizen** (18-65)

- **Role:** Voter, community organizer, or civic hobbyist tracking candidates before casting a ballot or supporting campaigns
- **Context:** Consumes news on mobile/desktop and shares findings in local groups or social media
- **Pain Points:** Raw filings are overwhelming, rhetoric often contradicts funding, limited time to compare sources
- **Goals:** Make informed voting decisions, raise community awareness, hold representatives publicly accountable

## The Problem

### Funding opacity fuels distrust

Campaign finance data is technically public but buried across filings, PDFs, and disconnected APIs. Analysts spend days cleaning data before they can even ask “Who funds this candidate?” or “Is this employer shifting allegiance?”. This slows accountability reporting, feeds partisan speculation, and leaves the public in the dark.

**Our Solution:** Aggregate donation data, apply transparent leaning scores, and surface trends via guided dashboards, graph explorers, and alignment indicators so that complex relationships are visible in minutes instead of days—with equal treatment for every party, ideology, and organization.

## Differentiators

### Narrative-friendly, nonpartisan transparency

Unlike generic FEC download portals or narrow donor lookup tools, we provide story-ready views (funding mix %, alignment scores, graph visualizations) that connect donations, messaging, and industry context—without injecting partisan language or favoritism. This results in faster reporting turnarounds, clearer narratives, and balanced accountability for end readers.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Candidate Funding Breakdown:** Show each candidate’s donation mix by leaning (left/right PACs), industries, and top employers to make disparities obvious.
- **Employer & Industry Explorer:** Let users select employers or industries to compare party splits, trends, and top-supported candidates over time.

### Collaboration Features

- **Messaging vs Funding Alignment:** Highlight where candidate rhetoric diverges from donor industries using NLP-extracted topics, enabling teams to share insight-rich clips or exports.

### Advanced Features

- **“Follow the Money” Graph Explorer:** Interactive network view that ties candidates, PACs, employers, and industries together with weighted edges and leaning-based node colors so analysts can explore complex relationships visually.
